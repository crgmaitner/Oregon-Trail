# The Oregon Trail
For this repository, I've designed a faithful representation of the classic browser game The Oregon Trail. Here, you'll travel the trail as you make your way to the promised land of Oregon. The journey won't be easy; and you'll have to make some difficult choices along the way. The goal is to make to the state of Oregon in one piece. You may choose to be a Banker from Boston, a Carpenter from Ohio, or a Farmer from Illinois. Each character starts with a specified amount of money to spend at the supply store (the banker has the most, the farmer the least), before beginning your journey. As you travel, random events will occur, potentially complicating your journey to ensure a safe arrival to your destination. The more of your party to make it to Oregon, the higher your final score will be! Now get on partner, the trails a waitin!
