                <h1>About the Trail</h1>
                <p>The Oregon Trail is a 2,170-mile historic east–west, wagon route and emigrant trail in the United States that connects the Missouri River to valleys in Oregon. The eastern half of the trail spans part of what is now Kansas, and nearly all of what are now the states of Nebraska and Wyoming. The western half of the trail spans most of what are now the states of Idaho and Oregon. From the early to mid-1830s (as well as through the years 1846–1869), the Oregon Trail was used by about 400,000 settlers, farmers, miners, ranchers, and business owners and their families.</p>
                <h2>How To Play</h2>
                <p>The goal is to travel The Oregon Trail to the state of Oregon. You may choose to be a Banker from Boston, a Carpenter from Ohio, or a Farmer from Illinois. Each character starts with a specified amount of money to spend at the supply store (the banker has the most, the farmer the least), before beginning your journey. As you travel, random events will occur and difficult choices must be made to ensure a safe arrival to your destination. The more of your party to make it to Oregon, the higher your final score will be!</p>
